## Problem 

Transform a to b
Given two integers, `a` and `b`, find a sequence of operations to transform `a` into `b`.
You can perform the following operation **any number** of times:
1.  Choose `x` such that `0 <= x <= a` (where `a` is the current value).
2.  Update `a` by setting `a = a ^ x` 

*Constraints*:
* `1<=a, b <= 10^9`

## Solution 

Choose `(a | b)` as intermediate value. 
Max ops is 2
