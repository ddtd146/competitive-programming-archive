`DP`
`Math`

## Problem 
Whether there exists a subsequence that sum of numbers is divisibe by m

## Solution 
***Obersevation.*** If $n \ge m$ than the answer is `YES` because we have n prefix sum and m module.

`dp[i][j]` indicates whether exists a subsequence in `[1..i]` that sum of numbers is divisibe by `j`
