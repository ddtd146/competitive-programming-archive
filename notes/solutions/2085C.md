`Math`

## Problem
Given `x`, `y`
Find `k` such that `(x + k) + (y + k) = (x + k) ^ (y+k)`

## Approach 
Let `bitx` and `bity` be the value (0 or 1) of the $i$-th bit of `x` and `y`

To achieve the goal, we need `bitx + bity < 2`, which means `bitx + bity` must equal `bitx ^ bity`.

## Solution
### Solution 1: Greedy


For a simple implementation, target the pair (1, 0). (Ignore (0, 0) and (1, 1) because they result in infinite k).

To do this:

1. Case (1, 1): Must turn on the bit in k
2. Case (1, 0): If the next pair is (0, 0) or (1, 1), turn on the bit in `k` as well
### Solution 2: Formula

Target the pair (1, 0) and (0, 0) in final (x, y). 

To do this: choose `k = 2^n - max(x, y)`

then `mx` becomes `1000..00`
