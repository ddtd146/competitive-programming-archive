## Problem 

Given `a(n), b(n) `

Given `k` turns. In 1 turn, perform 1 op: 
1. `+: ai += bi`

2. `-: ai -= bi`

score = Max(ij) S(i,j)  = ai + ... + aj
Alice wants to maximize the score and Bob wants to minimize

## Solution

If 1 player performs operation 1, the other can perform operation 2 to cancel the effect.

So `k` is reduced to `k mod 2`
So the problem becomes finding max subarray sum after applying the operation to an index i
