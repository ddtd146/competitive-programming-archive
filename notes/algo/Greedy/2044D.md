## Problem 

[Link](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/2044/D)

## Observation

1. Mod of [8, 8, 9, 9] are both 8 and 9 


## Solution

Goal is keeping the element frequencies in prefix array nearly the same 
So in each loop: 
1. If "needed", set $b[i] = a[i]$ 
2. Otherwise, set $b[i] =$ anything to achive goal 

The following implementation enforces the strict constraint: $ \exists i, j : a[i] = b[j] $
