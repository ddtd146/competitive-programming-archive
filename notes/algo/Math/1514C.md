# 1514C Codeforces

## Problem 

## Solution 
So first observe that the subsequence can't contain any element that isn't coprime with $n$. Why? Because then its product won't be coprime with $n$, so when you take it modulo $n$, it can't be 1. In mathier words, $gcd(prod mod n,n) = gcd(prod,n) \ne 1$. Now, let's take all elements less than $n$ and coprime with it, and let's look at their product modulo $n$; call it $p$. If $p$ is 1, you can take all these elements. Otherwise, you should take them all except for $p$. It belongs to them because $p$ is coprime with $n$, since $gcd(p mod n,n)=gcd(p,n)=1$ since all the elements in $p$ are coprime with n$$.
